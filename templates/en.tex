\begin{enumerate}
	\item The solution must have at least one row, one column, or one diagonal where all five elements are checked.
	\item If a cell is not checked, the condition written in the grid must not be satisfied.
	\item The solution is unique.
	\item Random seed: random\_seed, number of iterations: round\_num
